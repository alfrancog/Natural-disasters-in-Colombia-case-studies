# The characteristics of the Mocoa compound disaster event, Colombia
### Synopsis #3

Thanks to the advanced use of geographic information software (GIS), statistical elements, and 
computational tools, it was possible to reconstruct all the events that had occurred prior to the 
large landslide that occurred in Mocoa, Putumayo, on April 1, 2017. This article helps to 
understand this contingency as a consequence of the combination of hostile weather and adverse
terrain conditions, which caused an enormous natural disaster that killed more than 300 people
in the town.

The origin of this tragic calamity had two main causes: the location of Mocoa in an area with 
steep slopes next to a highly eroded mountain, and the intense climatic conditions that have 
been affecting the region in recent years. During the period between 2014 and 2016, Colombian 
territories were suffering a quite intense El Niño season that brought droughts and reduced 
vegetation in the country; after this time, there was an abrupt change to the La Niña season
in 2017 that triggered abundant rainfalls and unfavourable weather conditions for rural 
populations.

The long period of El Niño affected the vegetation's ability to retain water within the soil, 
subsequently, lots of areas of ​​mountain slopes were exposed to the intense rainfalls that
occurred during 2017 all over the country, causing landslides and debris flows in the rivers. 
Finally, it is evident that "in this disaster event, heavy rainfalls induced landslides and 
mountain torrents" (Cheng et al, 2018), reinforcing the idea that small-scale geological hazards
are capable of producing a large-scale disaster if all its effects converge and influence each 
other.
