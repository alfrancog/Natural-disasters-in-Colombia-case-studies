# Vulnerability and Site Effects in Earthquake Disasters in Armenia (Colombia). II – Observed Damages and Vulnerability
###### Synopsis #2

This article compares and contrasts two vulnerability evaluations made in Armenia, Quindío,
in 1993 and 2004, which are very important benchmarks given that between these dates an 
earthquake seriously affected the city, on January 25, 1999. 

The vulnerability evaluation made in 1993 showed the abundance of poor quality buildings, 
mainly represented by unreinforced masonry and bahareque constructions, as well as lack of 
frame structures and confined masonry. Many of them were built before 1984, when the first
national building code was published in Colombia seeking to implement earthquake-resistant 
constructions. After the 1999 earthquake, it was evidenced that more than 90% of the buildings
designed under the earthquake-resistant code had suffered light or no damage, proving their safety.

On the other hand, the vulnerability evaluation made in 2004 showed that the number of buildings 
with high, medium, and low vulnerability had almost the same proportion as in 1993; actually, more 
than 50% of the buildings were still classified as unsafety and highly vulnerable to earthquakes.

It was concluded that, in the case of Armenia, rather than the characteristics of the soil or the 
nearby presence of geological faults, the vulnerability of buildings is more linked to their number
of storeys and the quality of their structure. Those elements were the main causes of 2.000 
casualties due to the collapse of 15.000 houses and severe damage in more than 20.000 
constructions, hence, it is worrying that construction conditions have not improved in the 
city even after the 1999 earthquake.
