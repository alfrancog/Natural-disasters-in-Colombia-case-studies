#  Importance of environmental education in socio-natural risk management in five countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.

Disaster prevention through education is not as simple as it sounds, it contains many technical
terminologies for many of us, but in this article, some concepts such as risk management,
vulnerability and threat were described in a way that brings us closer to environmental education,
remarking the importance of its understanding in order to apply it in the following readings.

As a contextualization, the authors present a bibliographic review of the theoretical-technical
framework of risk management in five different countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, 
those most exposed to natural disasters and who have suffered the most human losses as a result 
of them: Chile, Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico and Nicaragua.  They also compared and contrasted how 
different those plans are in the way in which they deal with the prevention, mitigation and 
monitoring of disasters.

They found that in Colombia and Mexico, risk management is more oriented in rescue,
rehabilitation and reconstruction stages, instead of preventing and preparing the population at 
risk; while Chile, Jamaica and Nicaragua have strong drill programs which focus risk management
on precaution, prevention and self-care. But those legislations have lots of implementation flaws
that leave gaps of knowledge in the people they are trying to educate, being a common issue all 
those countries have.

Finally, I would like to express the necessity of reorienting risk management regulations to
the socio-natural threats that communities are exposed to, focusing on environmental education
that must be implemented from schools. In my opinion, promoting environmental education in society
becomes a tool that allows them to know their territory and increases the ability for empowerment,
in order to take the proper decisions in certain natural situations.
