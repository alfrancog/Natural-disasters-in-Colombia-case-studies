# Hurricane Iota, a destroying consequence of climate variability.
### Review #2

Hurricane Iota was the largest natural disaster that has occurred in Colombia last year. 
In this newspaper article, the author states that the conditions in which the hurricane 
developed, leave us too much to think about the actions that the government could take 
in the future to soften the effects of future weather events like this one.

More than a consequence of climate change, the intense hurricane season that took place in 2020
is explained by Emel Vega, an important meteorology professor in Colombia, as a product of *climate 
variability* due to abnormal temperatures on the coast and the ocean. According to these statements,
these anomalies are not yet fully understood in the country, and they are of vital importance when
it comes to predicting the climatic events that will take place in the short term.

But more than blame the hurricane for the disaster, in my view, the responsibility falls on the 
government that did not take quick action on the island of Providencia, which ended with 98% of 
its infrastructure destroyed, 5.000 people homeless and four killed. We can see that this lack of 
proactivity is been evident in all the hurricanes that Colombia has experienced, such as Hurricane
Joan that hit Manzanillo del Mar, in Cartagena in 1988, or Hurricane Cesar that hit the island of
San Andrés in 1996.

Finally, the possibility of experiencing more and stronger hurricanes is always present, so we need
to demand our governments for joint work among countries for investing in research on these
meteorological phenomena, that severely affects different countries every year, and also, to
generate early warnings and evacuation strategies to minimize the risk that inhabitants of 
the Colombian islands are exposed when hurricanes occur.
