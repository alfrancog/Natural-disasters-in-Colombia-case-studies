# About me 

My name is Alejandro Franco Garc√≠a. I am a 19 years old student of a Bachelor in Geology, at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. My interests are related with 
seismology, computer sciences and languages learning. I love natural and exact sciences, doing sports, traveling to different places of my country and learning 
something new every day.

I firmly believe in the importance of the divulgation of geological events and natural disasters that have occurred in the past as a way of educating people that
live in areas at risk, in order to prevent threats and harms in the future. Natural disasters are an inherent topic in my undergraduate program that have interested
me for a long time, for this reason, I am part of a group in geological and environmental risks that especially analyzes this type of situation in our country, and
a group in seismology that emphazises in learning the physics behind earthquakes as well.
