# Leveraging lessons learned to prevent future disasters—insights from the 2013 Colombia-US binational exchange
###### Review #3
The governments of the USA and Colombia were seeking an experience of empirical learning when they 
joined forces and designed an exchange program between scientists and rescue departments, which 
would promote in them the understanding of possible disasters in volcanic areas and the importance 
of generating effective mitigation strategies to save lives.

This exchange program consisted of the visit of 10 Colombian researchers and rescuers to Mount 
Rainier Volcano in the US and socializing mitigation plans. In the same way, 10 American 
specialists visited Nevado del Ruiz Volcano, went to the affected populations of Armero and 
Chinchiná to identify their risk scenarios, and learned how threats were being monitored in 
Colombia.

The outcomes of the exchange on the participants were amazing and left great impacts on them, 
the personal experience they had in learning about the special conditions that characterize each
country, as well as learning first-hand about the disasters that took place in the past were very
enriching. In my opinion, the insights that this kind of learning generates are the most useful, 
these sorts of experiences are hardly forgotten because they generate an appropriation of the 
purpose in which people work, especially when human lives are at stake.

In brief, the above arguments reinforce my view that lives can be saved through education. The
participants of the international exchange encouraged the implementation of educational strategies
to children, teaching them how to identify the signs that precede emergencies and how to act when
they happen; likewise, they plan to use tourism in areas threatened by natural disasters to educate 
their visitors and not only the inhabitants of these places, which I find amazing with the broader 
scope it will reach in the future.
