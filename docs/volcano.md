# The 1985 Nevado del Ruiz volcano catastrophe: anatomy and retrospection
### Synopsis #1

This article relates the events that occurred before and after the night of November 13, 1985, 
when Nevado del Ruiz Volcano erupted killing more than 25000 people.  One year before the 
catastrophe, the volcano began in an abnormality phase characterized by small eruptions and 
numerous earthquakes.  Anticipating a big eruption, some geologists from Manizales created 
an emergency committee whose purposes were to supervise the volcanic activity and warn the 
population of the danger they were facing, but not much was achieved due to the slowness of 
the government’s actions.

Some hours before the eruption, in the afternoon of November 13, a small phreatic eruption took 
place, but the authorities did not emit an evacuation order; after this, an explosive eruption 
around 9:00 p.m. led to the melting of 10% of the glacial of the snow-capped volcano. That huge
amount of water got mixed with ashes, pyroclastic flows, soil, rocks and trees; producing three 
colossal hot flows of debris known as lahars which flowed down through the river beds.  Soon, they
reached the towns and overflowed some rivers, burying more than 25.000 people under a layer of mud
of 8 meters thick on average, in the municipalities of Armero and Mariquita, in Tolima, and 
Chinchiná, in Caldas.

Additionally, it was developed an exhaustive analysis of all the elements that may have contributed 
to the tragedy; indeed, most of them took place mainly due to the accumulation of human errors.
Of course, certain conditions exacerbated the situation, but the biggest mistake can be attributed 
to "indecision and bureaucratic short-sightedness, [..] in the end, the authorities were unwilling
to bear the economic or political costs of early evacuation or a false alarm, and they delayed 
action to the last possible minute" (Voight, 1990).
